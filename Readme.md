# My New Blog
This blog is based on HUGO, a awesome go project.

## Notes for myself
How to create an article:
```shell
hugo new posts/first_post.md
```

To build the project (to `/public`)
```shell
hugo
```

To run locally
```shell
# Normal mode
hugo serve
# To check comment system, cdn and fingerprint
hugo serve -e production
```
